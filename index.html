							<div class="features">
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-code"></span>
									<h3>Coding Capability</h3>

								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-lock"></span>
									<h3>Security is Priority #1</h3>
									<p>I take great pride in my work such that I take great amounts of effort and care into establishing a project that will be watertight, tight-knit and not loose in any possible case I can come up with.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-cog"></span>
									<h3>Change is Important</h3>
									<p>It's good to know when something needs to change whether it's because something isn't working, or simply is just not as effective as it can be, I can always be relied to tidy up those areas.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-desktop"></span>
									<h3>Tech-Savvy</h3>

									<h3>Overall. Quality.</h3>
									<p>When you create something, whether or not it's for someone else to see or for only your eyes as the creator, I need to have a line of quality that acts as a threshhold for my work, because that is what allows me to create such well-made projects, and every project, that bar for me just grows ever so higher.</p>
